The "**Consumer / Update It?**" dashboard complements the main VM configuration dashboard by displaying the actual VMs, with their relevant information. It is designed for vSphere administrator and platform team, to facilitate the follow-up action with the VM owners. It is a part of 8 dashboards that check the environment for optimization opportunities.

The dashboard follows the same design consideration with the [Consumer / Correct it?](/dashboards/chapter-4-configuration-dashboards/3.4.7-consumer-correct-it/) dashboard. In fact, the 8 dashboards that form the Optimization Flow is designed as a set. You are meant to use them together as you go through the optimization review process.

## How to Use

The dashboard is just a collection of tables (List View), which can be reviewed independently. There is no flow among them.

Click the object name to navigate to the Object Summary page to view more configurations. There can be valid reasons why specific configurations are not followed. It is recommended that you discuss best practices with VMware.
