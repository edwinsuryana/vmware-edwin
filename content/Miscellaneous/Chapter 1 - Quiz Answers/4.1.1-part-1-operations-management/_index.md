## Performance SLA

You should exclude CPU Co-Stop from Performance SLA because the reason for CoStop could be the VM itself. IaaS SLA should not measure problems beyond your control. Read [this](/metrics/chapter-2-cpu-metrics/2.2.2-vm/#co-stop) for details.

You should exclude CPU Contention from Performance SLA because its value can go as high as 37.5% without the application noticing any degradation. You can login to Windows or Linux and feel it's responsive. Read [this](/metrics/chapter-2-cpu-metrics/2.2.2-vm/#contention) for details.

## "Good" Advice

The problem with the advice is it assumes utilization as the metric for performance. You want to drive by contention, while aiming to maximize utilization.
