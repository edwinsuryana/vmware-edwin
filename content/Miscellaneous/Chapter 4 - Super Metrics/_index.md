### Chapter 4

# Super Metrics

I've used the product since 1.0. When I first saw super metrics, it was one of those "**is this created for me?**" moment. The ability to analyze hundreds of metrics by creating my own metrics enabled me to do my job better. I was a pre-sales engineer but I spent a lot of time helping my customers troubleshooting and optimizing their environment.
