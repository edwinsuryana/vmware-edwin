I learned about counters from esxtop and vRealize Operations. For me, esxtop provides the raw metrics, and insight into how ESXi does accounting. In esxtop you get to see how physical (ESXi) and virtual (world) are accounted differently. There are many great materials on esxtop, especially from Valentin Bondzio, where he explains the counters in depth.
