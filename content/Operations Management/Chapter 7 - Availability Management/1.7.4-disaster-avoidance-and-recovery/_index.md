There are operational impact when you add capability to handle disaster. There are 3 primary use cases:

#### Disaster Avoidance

You avoid disaster by doing long distance vMotion on an stretched vSphere cluster.

- Do you have enough WAN bandwidth?
- Does the vMotion complete within the expected time? - If not, what's causing it?
- What's the performance impact during the vMotion? As the pipe is shared, this can impact other VMs too.

#### DR Test

You are doing a test, as required by regulator or internal Business Continuity Plan. Your production VM is still running, so you need to bubble the network.

- Do you have enough resources on the recovery site?
- Did it complete within the expected time? If not, what's causing it?

#### DR Actual

You are doing the actual recovery. This can be planned or unplanned.

- Do you have enough resources?
- What's the performance impact on the target cluster and datastore?

In a large environment, you can have multiple clusters parcitipating in active/active DR, protecting one another. This can create complex relationship, especially if you have hundreds of business applications and they span across clusters.
